CLASSROOM SUPPORT SERVICE

Nowadays training methodology is changing very fast. New modern learning approaches has been developed and integrate in global learning process. All new features of learning oriented and directed into increasing of speed of education process and making level of users knowledge wider. The primary requirements for any learning facility is to provide condition which will be result in forming some new individual knowledge of user and give good mental training to create possibility of user to use all new individual knowledge to find the way to make clear some task which will be faced before users. But the best final study result is to prepare users to give them possibility to work out of rules which means that they should work not in general tasks, but try to make clear more complicated tasks that they don’t have enough ability to do that in fact yet. Of course new knowledge of user of education will be result of learning process (professional level of learning material, learning and teaching tools design, learning process structure facility) and user facilities (mental user characteristic, motivation).

Face to face, principle of educational structure has been the most fruitful for learning facility for many years. Classroom lesson is the one of the useful in user-tutor interrogation. It is because during classroom lesson user takes a part of tutor show which tries to involve user to feel and live though the specific subject of lesson. Level of subject feeling is a result of tutor experience level and subject of material quality. Addition to that classroom show initiate different information flows to user which usually mixes different types of memory: visual, audial and tactical. All incoming information flows to user should to make user to understand key points of lesson independent of the user mental type. In this case classroom lesson is oriented into different mental types of users and will make possible to give approximately the same level of knowledge, which also depends on learning ability of person.

Classroom activity is not only single way of preparing user knowledge ability. In learning process user should meet some problems face to face and should try to use all new knowledge to make them clear. Also during that user should try to feel problem by himself. In some cases user should work under some parts of information that needs more time for learning from user. That is why classroom learning process should be mixed with self-study activity. Volume of self-study have to be equal to some part of classroom activity and calculated according to mental possibility of user. Classroom lesson and self-study activity will produce the best study result by changing different mind activity and will help to use new knowledge in different memory levels.

Nowadays computer based technology helps to support learning activities through different ways. The most valuable task of computer based support is to organize learning process and give users tools to information management. These systems are known as classroom support service (CSS). During the education user has to use different study materials, but usually it needs too many materials that hold necessary information. That is why software have to provide intellectual and well organized information management module which is the core of easy navigation. Also users have got different level of knowledge, logic and mental activity. Therefore interface of this information management module has to recognize user facility and automatically configuration software ability to speed up learning.


In technical aspects CSS may be designed as off-line (self-packed) or has been grounded under net-based technologies. Internet-based services are the most useful today, because their usage makes study easy everywhere. Users do not need to be close with some specific computer or laptop. Today cross-platform technology shares study process into different electronic devices such as tablet, cell phones, eBooks, navigators and many others. All of that erase time learning limits. Users can study everywhere and every when. Different standards try to realize unique approach to make systems with the same study material structure that helps users in easy orientation at basic operational functionality.

According to study activity, CSS has to support all tasks of classroom lessons and gives guidelines for self-study organize. Impact of CSS during classes are sharing study materials, knowledge control or testing, student –teacher interaction, sharing additional information, personal tasks and competition support, virtual working place (next step of virtual blackboard), team work and many others. For example, it can provide remote access for users outside of class, which did not join meeting. The CSS for self-study activity support is the other hand. Self-study activity of user is the most difficult part of learning structure, because it should give tasks oriented into different mental levels of users and different level of input knowledge.

All the mention above makes CSS a unique tool to achieve the main goals of learning.
